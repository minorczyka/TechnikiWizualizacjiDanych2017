"ANAKIN";" Well, there's more than one way out of here. ";236;22;" ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What was that all about? ";286;36;" ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can. ";288;36;" ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He's trying! ";290;36;" ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Are you all right? ";299;38;" GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I was about to say that. ";303;38;" GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count. ";313;38;" GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I shouldn't . . . ";327;39;" GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" ... I couldn't stop myself. ";330;39;" GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. ";333;39;" GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way. ";335;39;" GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right. ";340;39;" GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" His fate will be the same as ours. ";342;39;" GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . . ";351;42;" ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224. ";353;42;" ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in! ";355;42;" ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast. ";375;50;" ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation. ";384;53;" ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Hold on. ";387;53;" ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator! ";391;53;" ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy? ";398;54;" ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I agree. ";406;57;" DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't know. ";408;57;" DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on. ";411;57;" DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Well, that was close. ";418;59;" HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Ray shields! ";425;61;" HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted. ";428;61;" HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You're the Master. I'm just a hero. ";430;61;" HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I say . . . patience. ";434;61;" HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . . ";436;61;" HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) See! No problem. ";438;61;" HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected. ";449;62;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Artoo. ";454;62;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" All the escape pods have been launched. ";490;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing? ";492;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in. ";495;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins. ";499;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" We lost something. ";502;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down. ";504;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What's our speed? ";506;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Grab that . . . Keep us level. ";509;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields. ";511;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" We're coming in too hot. ";515;67;" BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master? ";523;69;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time. ";525;69;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness. ";527;69;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . . ";529;69;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of. ";541;69;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that. ";549;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Excuse me. ";552;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so. ";556;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges. ";558;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married. ";562;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you. ";564;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on? ";567;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it? ";569;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on! ";571;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" . . . Is there someone else? ";574;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all. ";576;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" It's just that I've never seen you like this . . . ";578;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" That's . . . that's wonderful. ";583;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life. ";585;70;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment. ";603;73;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You are so beautiful! ";605;73;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" No, it's because I'm so in love with you. ";607;73;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . . ";609;73;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I haven't laughed in so long . . . ";612;73;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Nothing . . . ";626;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you. ";628;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" It was a dream. ";630;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died. ";632;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" It was about you. ";634;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" It was only a dream. ";637;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) You die in childbirth . . . ";639;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't know. ";641;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme. ";644;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I know â€¦. ";647;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (suspicious) Have you told him anything? ";649;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything! ";651;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem. ";653;76;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" They are of pain, suffering, death . . . ";657;77;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Someone . . . ";659;77;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes. ";661;77;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda. ";663;77;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What must I do, Master Yoda? ";665;77;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse. ";672;79;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What's wrong then? ";674;79;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war. ";676;79;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Be careful of what? ";678;79;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What for? ";680;79;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it? ";682;79;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust? ";684;79;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate? ";689;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way. ";691;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments. ";693;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Everyone will agree on that. ";695;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Of course. ";697;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What do you mean? ";699;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir. ";701;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" For what? I don't understand. ";703;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this. ";707;80;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order. ";737;83;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I understand. ";739;83;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master? ";742;83;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Forgive me, Master. ";744;83;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet. ";755;83;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting! ";762;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . . ";764;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" That has nothing to do with this. ";766;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You mean divided loyalties. ";768;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve. ";770;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie. ";772;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying. ";774;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" And? ";776;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What situation? ";778;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason! ";780;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session? ";782;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here. ";784;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer. ";786;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me? ";788;84;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Beautiful, isn't it? ";817;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" How are you feeling? ";821;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He?! Why do you think it's a boy? ";823;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl. ";826;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master. ";829;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem. ";831;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic. ";833;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (suspicious) What do you mean? ";835;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist! ";837;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy! ";839;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Nothing. ";841;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. ";843;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me. ";845;87;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You wanted to see me, Chancellor. ";854;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. ";856;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" They try. ";858;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I'm not sure I understand. ";862;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't think . . . ";864;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I know they don't trust you . . . ";866;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken. ";868;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't know ... I don't know what to say. ";872;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Jedi use their power for good. ";874;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" . . . evil. ";876;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves. ";878;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others. ";880;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I'm not sure it's wrong. ";883;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" No. ";887;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He could actually save people from death? ";889;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What happened to him? ";891;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Is it possible to learn this power? ";893;88;" CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau. ";901;90;" KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign. ";905;90;" KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous. ";912;90;" KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact. ";914;90;" KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" That would be dangerous. ";965;95;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" When you present the ""petition of the two thousand"" to the Chancellor, things may change. ";972;95;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You're going to need me on this one, Master. ";977;96;" CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Master! ";980;96;" CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me. ";982;96;" CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Well, there's always a first time. ";986;96;" CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you. ";989;96;" CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He will soon have Grievous's head. ";1010;100;" CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Council was very sure in its decision. ";1012;100;" CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Hi, Jar Jar. ";1018;101;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Not fit? Why would anyone think that? ";1022;101;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" That's ridiculous. Who?!? ";1024;101;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" That's impossible. I would know. ";1026;101;" CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he? ";1037;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What did he want? ";1039;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You told him about us, didn't you? ";1042;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" And he's not? ";1045;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I'm not moody . . . ";1047;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't know ... I feel . . . lost. ";1049;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me. ";1051;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't. ";1053;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I have found a way to save you. ";1056;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" From my nightmares. ";1058;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I won't lose you, Padme. ";1060;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying. ";1062;103;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What do you mean? ";1154;116;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . . ";1156;116;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I'm sure you're mistaken. ";1158;116;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala. ";1160;116;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes, Master. ";1169;117;" CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous. ";1179;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I should be there with him. ";1181;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me. ";1183;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" How do you know the ways of the Force? ";1186;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You know the dark side?!? ";1189;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family. ";1191;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What did you say? ";1193;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You're a Sith Lord! ";1195;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You're wrong! ";1198;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I would certainly like to. ";1200;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council. ";1203;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I will quickly discover the truth of all this. ";1205;118;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Master Windu, I must talk to you. ";1234;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord. ";1236;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes. The one we have been looking for. ";1238;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side. ";1240;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Absolutely. ";1242;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him. ";1244;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I must go, Master. ";1246;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes, Master. ";1248;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes, Master. ";1250;124;" JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I can't do this ... I can't let her die. ";1257;125;" CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial. ";1297;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" It is not the Jedi way . . . ";1300;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (continuing) He must live . . . ";1302;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I need him . . . ";1304;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" NO!!! ";1306;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What have I done? ";1312;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I will do whatever you ask. ";1315;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death. ";1317;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith. ";1320;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Thank you. my Master. ";1322;128;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate. ";1330;130;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I understand, Master. ";1332;130;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy? ";1334;130;" CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe. ";1500;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . . ";1506;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself. ";1508;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you. ";1517;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor. ";1520;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate. ";1522;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over. ";1525;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" That won't happen. I won't let it. ";1527;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise. ";1530;162;" CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"

"ANAKIN";" Artoo . . . stay with the ship. ";1596;170;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious. ";1673;185;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Yes, My Master. ";1675;185;" CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Padme, I saw your ship . . . ";1762;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here? ";1765;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What things? ";1767;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me. ";1769;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Us??! ";1771;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough. ";1773;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that. ";1775;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you. ";1777;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be. ";1779;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me. ";1781;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Because of Obi-Wan? ";1784;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar! ";1786;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me! ";1789;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" What have you and she been up to? ";1793;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You turned her against me. ";1796;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You will not take her from me. ";1798;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire. ";1804;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Don't make me kill you. ";1806;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" If you're not with me, you're my enemy. ";1808;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You will try. ";1811;195;" MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side. ";1845;200;" MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion. ";1854;202;" MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . . ";1915;214;" MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil. ";1917;214;" MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise. ";1919;214;" MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
"ANAKIN";" You underestimate my power! ";1922;214;" MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY";3;"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"
